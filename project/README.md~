Here is my lab for the Blinky Buzzy Toy.
To compile this code we run make followed by make load in the project
directory inside the project directory. State 1 flashes both the red and green
Leds and plays a snipet of the Pokemon Theme song. State 2 plays a snipet of
the Mario Bros theme song and flashes only the red led. State 3 playes a
snipet of Remember me from Coco and flashes only the green leds. State 4 also
plays the Mario theme songs and flashes only the green leds. This code uses a
Jump Table to implement the switch cases which determine which song to play.
