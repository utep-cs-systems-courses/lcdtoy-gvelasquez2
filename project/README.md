Here is my lab for the LCD Toy LAB 3 ASSIGNMENT.
To compile this code we run "make"
Followed by "make load" in the project directory inside the lcd-toy directory.
After we can use "make clean" to remove files generated when compiling.


State 1:
This is my Pokemon State. It will display a Pokeball drawn using rectangles
on the lcd screen and then it will play the Pokemon season 1 theme song.

State 2:
This is my Mario State. It will display Mario's Catch phrase on the lcd screen
and then play the Mario Bros theme.

State 3:
This state will play a tune from the movie Coco and displays my name bouncing
around the screen in green before stopping in the center and changing font
color to red.

State 4:
This state will display 4 squares moving accross the screen in a diagonal
fashion until interrupted.
